# Rename local branch

If you're create a local branch with name `my-ugly-branch` and figured out that this name sounds ugly, you can simply rename (or better *move*) your branch with the following command:

```bash
$ git branch -m <oldname> <newname>
$ # git branch -m my-ugly-branch my-better-named-branch
```

A way to remember this, is `-m` is for **move**.
