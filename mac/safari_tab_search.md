# Safari tab search

I use safari for my daily research and have a lot of tabs open and pinned.
Sometimes I'm looking for a very specific tab and lost myself in the tab-crowd :wink:

In this case I need something like *⌘ + F*

And here it is (with one step more)…

* Hit `⌘ + Shift + /` to enter Safari's **Show all tabs**-mode.
* Hit `⌘ + F` to search a specific tab by words.
